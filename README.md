### Linters

It's recommended to set up seamless integration with your editor.

* ESLint statically analyzes your code to find problems in JavaScript quickly. (editor-integration)
* Prettier enforces a code formatting style guide for consistency across the team. (editor-integration)
* Stylelint helps avoid errors and enforces conventions in styles. (editor-integration)

> Note: For an optimal development experience in VS Code install recommended workspace extensions.
> When using VS Code, most ESLint and Stylelint conventions will be fixed automatically.
